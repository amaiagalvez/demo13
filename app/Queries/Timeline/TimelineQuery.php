/**
 * The timeline screen: the active projects that belong on the board, in the order they start,
 * each one carrying the active epics drawn underneath it, all of it ready to be painted on one
 * shared month axis.
 *
 * A project belongs on the board when a search term matches its own name, its customer's name, or
 * any of its epics. Matching the project brings every one of its epics along, because the row
 * stands for the whole project; matching only an epic leaves the project as the context that
 * holds it and keeps its other epics off the board, which is how narrow a search stays on the
 * flat planning screen.
 *
 * The board is a page of projects rather than a page of rows, so the ordering that picks that
 * page spans two tables: the ids are read first and only the records the page names are then
 * loaded whole, with their epics.
