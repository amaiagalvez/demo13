/**
 * The planning screen: the active projects, ordered by the day they are due and grouped by the
 * quarter they finish in, ready to be drawn either as a roadmap or on a timeline.
 *
 * Projects are the rows: their epics are the count on the row, and a customer carries no dates, so
 * it is the trail under a row rather than a row of its own. A row with no end date has no bar and
 * no quarter, and lands last.
 *
 * The ordering needs both tables at once, so the page is picked from a cheap id-only read of the two
 * and only the records that page names are then loaded whole. That keeps both the rows the database
 * hydrates and the records the browser receives to one page, which is the point of the screen.
